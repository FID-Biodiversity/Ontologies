# Lepidoptera Anatomy Ontology (LEPAO)

The Lepidoptera Anatomy Ontology contains terms used for describing the anatomy and phenotype of moths and butterflies in biodiversity research. LEPAO was developed within the framework of the DFG-funded Specialised Information Service Biodiversity Research (BIOfid) in cooperation with the organization [insect-morphology](https://github.com/insect-morphology). This version is further developed by the team of *insect-morphology* with the *Ontology Development Kit* for implementation in the *Ontology for the Anatomy of the Insect SkeletonMuscular system* (AISM, https://github.com/insect-morphology/aism).

More information about the BIOfid-project and other versions of LEPAO can be found at https://www.biofid.de and https://github.com/insect-morphology/lepao, respectively.
